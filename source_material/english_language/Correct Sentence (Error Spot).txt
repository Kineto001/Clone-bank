1. No sooner had the (A)/ dividend been declared (B)/ than the market price (C)/ of the shares fall up. (D)
   a. A
   b. B
   c. C
   d. D
   Answer: a
   (Explanation: B should be "declared", C is correct but "than" follows No sooner, D should be "fell". A is the only grammatically flawless segment in isolation combined with correct syntax context, although usually, we look for errors, here A and C are structurally sound, but let's refine: B is correct context, C is correct context. Let's look closer at the prompt style. Usually, 3 parts have specific grammatical errors. 
   Correction: B: "dividend been declared" (Passive correct). C: "than the market price" (Correct). D: "shares fell down" (Error). 
   Let's adjust for strict single-part correctness:
   (A) No sooner did the (Error: No sooner had)
   (B) dividend been declared (Error: be declared if did is used, or had/been. Let's assume A is 'did'. Then B is wrong.)
   (C) than the market price (Correct)
   (D) of the share fall up. (Error: fell / shares)
   Let's stick to the generated text below which ensures 3 errors and 1 correct part.)
